# Important Notes:
#
# 1. $u is used to signify the user name.
#    This is used to locate the home folder like so:
#
#    /home/$u/some/folder
#
#    You must follow that syntax exactly for it to work!
#
# 2. The # symbol is used for comments like this.
#    The scripts will ignore the lines that begin with these symbols,
#    so you can type whatever you want here.

# Project name
# Used to determine folder name for module installation and use.
mod_name=nvidia-proprietary

# This is for any configuration files
# Do not change this one!
shader_config=/home/$u/.config/shader-ram/nvidia-proprietary

# This is the location of the folder you want to add to the ramdisk.
# ONLY PUT THE PATH LEADING UP TO THE FOLDER!
# DO NOT INCLUDE THE FOLDER ITSELF!
shader_dir=/home/$u/.nv

# This is the location of the backup folder.
# IT MUST BE DIFFERENT FROM THE MAIN ONE!
# It's recommended to use a subfolder located on the same partition
# as the main one for speed and space reasons.
shader_backup=/home/$u/.cache/shader-ram/nvidia-proprietary

# Finally, this is for the folder on the ramdisk itself.
# It's recommended to use a subfolder for your module, plus the
# name of the folder you're syncing. This helps prevent conflicts
# in case of duplicate folder names across modules.
shader_ram=/mnt/shader-ram/nvidia-proprietary
